		<h1>The Land of Felwinter</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		
		
		<div id="map" class="map">
			<p><img src="map.png" alt="Map of Murioc"></p>
		</div>
			
			<p>Found on the northernmost tip of a peninsula, FelWinter is a cold forest shrouded in 
			mist and mountain peaks. The forest's boundaries spread far south until the mountains seal 
			them in; a narrow pass provides passage to a great desert of red sand. This continent, Murioc, 
			is relatively middling in size, located in a vast sea, perforated by a network of large 
			interior lakes and rivers that  feed and nourish corridors of greed, purple, and yellow that 
			carve through the ruddy sands. As the sands draw closer to the shore, they bleach white to the 
			east and darken black to the west where the great volcano, Alforis, clogs the air with brown, 
			choking smoke. Small city states dot the land, walled cities forming alliances and trading with 
			each other, lending skills and people across borders. The greatest dangers are native to the land 
			itself-- terrifying and awe-inspiring beasts , rifts to other planes of existence, ancient 
			geological formations that glow with the aura of primal magic. Remnants of fallen nations 
			litter the sands and ancient artifacts lie buried in the dunes.</p>
		
		<h2>Core Assumptions</h2>
		
		
		<p>The gods are real.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They agreed to withdraw from meddling directly with every day life on the material plane 
				after a major war between them nearly tore the planet asunder, ending early civilization and 
				creating the network of rivers that runs through the continent. They now use mortals as proxies 
				from behind the astral gate,and seek to test the boundaries of this agreement. The exception to 
				this rule is the Raven Queen.</li>
				<li>The Matron of the Ravens is the only deity permitted to manifest on the material plane, replacing 
				Kelemvor, the former death god, slain by Orcus during the planar war. Her powers are legion and she 
				is bound to escort the dead to the proper spheres of eternity. She bestows her blessing on champions 
				called reapers, or the grim guard.</li>
				<li>The Grim Guard are tasked with guarding the boundary of the astral gate, and prevent illegal crossover. 					The highest ranked of the guards can even cast their shadows across the planes to assist their queen in her duty.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The world is ancient, but unknown.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Civilization took many centuries to recover after the planar war, and all vestiges from the previous civilizations
				have been reduced to ruin. Explorers and thrill-seekers have uncovered some ancient histories and most educated or devout 
				individuals know some things about the war, but no one knows the whole story. Temples to dead gods lie buried under the 
				sands or overgrown by forrest or even underneath the sea. </li>
				<li>Ancient, powerful artifacts from a time of war and strife litter the continent, and strife and woe often follow in their wake.</li>					<li>Two other continents exist, but they lie far across the sea, and knowledge of their existence has been lost. One of these 
				continents has actually fallen beneath the sea.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Conflict shapes the world's history.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The defining major event of the world was the planar war, and even though city-state conflicts seem miniscule in 
				comparison, they still shape the interactions, prejudices, loves, hates, and dreams of those that life here.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>The lands are wild.</p>
		<p>Magic is everywhere.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Though they took many things with them when they retreated behind the planar gate, the gods left their greatest gift-- magic.</li>
				<li>Magic is the essence of a long-dead entity more powerful than even a god. In ancient texts, this entity is known as The Weaver, 
				and created the planet from its body and sacrificed it's life to give birth to the gods. Its breath suffused the air with remnants 
				of its power, and the gods became the first practitioners of the arcane arts.</li>
				<li>The gods could neither lock away nor erase such a pervasive energy in their exodus, thenceforth known as The Weave.</li>
				<li>Magic users are divided into two subtypes.</li>
			</ul>
				<p style="margin-left: 40px">Arcane Casters - wizards, sorcerers, bards, and warlocks (depending on their patron).</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px">These practitioners are gifted with the ability to channel the weave of their own power. All are born with some 							
						innate ability to sense and shape the weaver's last breath.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px">Some, like wizards or certain warlocks, must study or bargain to nurture this capability to its fullest potential.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px">Others, like sorcerers and bards, exhibit a powerful but unrefined control over the weave, either through genetic 
						selection, legacy, or sheer luck.</li>
					</ul>
				<p style="margin-left: 40px">Divine Casters - clerics, paladins, druids, and rangers.</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px">These practitioners nurture a bond with a deity or spirit and use that connection to guide their spellcasting. Clerics
						and paladins pray, offering a legal conduit past the planar gate, allowing a portion of godly power to walk their body 
						through the motions of weaving miracles. </li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px">Druids and rangers commune with nature in a similar way, allowing the weave itself to pass through their bodies.</li>
					</ul>
