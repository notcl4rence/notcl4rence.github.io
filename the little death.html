							<p>This +3 dagger is made of a shard of the Raven Queen's throne, carved from 
							it by the Queen's own knives. It is a thin rondel dagger of black iron, with golden 
							light glimmering across the blade's triangular surface. The tang is elegantly sculpted 
							into three raven's talons delicately gripping the blade. The hilt is a short section of 
							polished human bone, carved into the shape of a raven's leg, with script in an ancient 
							language etched in a spiral around its circumference, pulsing with golden light. At its 
							end is a pennant made of a scrap of jet-black velvet, which sublimates into nothingness 
							at the edges, and a golden-tipped raven feather - a piece of the Raven Queen's own 
							divine mantle, willingly given to her Champion. </p>
							<p>The dagger deals 1d4 + 3 + your Charisma modifier radiant or necrotic damage - you 
							choose when you make the attack. You have advantage on attack rolls made against undead 
							with this weapon, and against those creatures your strikes deal an additional 3d10 radiant 
							damage. Dealing damage to an undead creature with this weapon heals you for half the 
							damage you deal. Sundering attacks made against artifacts of Orcus deal maximum damage. 
							(This feature only works on objects tied to Orcus, not creatures.)</p>
							<p>If you commit an action that is against the tenets of the Raven Queen or against 
							specific instructions given to you by her, you take 5d10 psychic damage, but no more 
							than twice each day.</p>
							<p>The tenets of the Raven Queen are as follows, and are written in the etchings on the hilt:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Hold no pity for those who die as they were intended to, for death is the natural end of life.</li>
								<li>Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. Those who would bring about the end 
								before its proper calling, or try to escape inevitability, must be punished. It is your duty as an 
								instrument of the Queen.</li>
								<li>Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the 
								Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queen's throne.</li>
							</ul>
